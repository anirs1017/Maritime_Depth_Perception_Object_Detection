# Maritime_Depth_Perception_Object_Detection
<br><br>Developed a mechanism for depth-perception with stereoscopic cameras using computer vision and deep learning, as an alternative to LIDARs, for automated docking and navigation of maritime vessels. 
<br>Performed object detection by customizing YOLO v3 models for maritime objects. 
<br>Depth was estimated for objects at distances up to 2 miles.
